# Research & Content Guide: Model USDA 2026 Website

## 1. Executive Summary
**Project:** Model USDA Website
**Event Dates:** January 30 – February 1, 2026
**Location:** Walton Center for Planetary Health (WCPH), ASU Tempe Campus
**Host:** Swette Center for Sustainable Food Systems (Arizona State University)

**Core Mission:**
Model USDA is an immersive simulation designed to train the "NextGen" of food system leaders. It moves beyond lectures, inviting students to step into the shoes of federal decision-makers to navigate crises, negotiate policy, and solve complex agricultural problems.

**Primary Goal of Website:**
To serve as the central information hub for participants (students), ensuring they have access to scenario briefs, role-play guidelines, logistics, and the broader context of U.S. agriculture (efficiency, AI, and sustainability) required to succeed in the simulation.

## 2. Target Audience Analysis
* **Primary:** "NextGen" Students (Undergraduate/Graduate) from diverse backgrounds (engineering, policy, agriculture, sustainability).
    * *Needs:* Clear schedules, maps, accessible scenario data, and "how-to" guides for role-play.
* **Secondary:** Academic Partners & Faculty.
    * *Needs:* Verification of educational value, alignment with USDA/NextGen grant goals.
* **Tertiary:** Future Employers (USDA, Ag-Tech, Policy Orgs).
    * *Needs:* Evidence of student competency in negotiation and modern ag issues.

## 3. Key Themes & Narrative Arcs

### Theme A: "The Room Where It Happens"
The website should emphasize the *active* nature of the event. It is not a conference; it is a job simulation.
* **Tagline Idea:** "Don't just study policy. Negotiate it."
* **Key Keywords:** Simulation, Negotiation, Stakeholder, Decision-Making, Federal Register, Advocacy.

### Theme B: The "Efficiency vs. Equity" Tension
Participants must balance the historic drive for agricultural efficiency with modern demands for sustainability and equity.
* **Context:** U.S. farm output has tripled (1948–2017) while labor fell by 80%.
* **Tension Point:** While efficiency is high (producing more with less land/labor), new challenges like climate resilience, nutrition security, and rural economic viability (Scenario D) are pressing.

### Theme C: The Digital & AI Revolution
Modern agriculture is increasingly defined by AI and precision tech. This context is crucial for Scenario D (Rural Investment) and Scenario C (Urban Ag).
* **Context:** AI in agriculture is projected to be a \$4.2 billion market by 2028.
* **Relevance:** Students must understand that "farming" now involves autonomous tractors, drone monitoring, and AI-driven yield optimization.

## 4. Content Modules & Data Source Mapping

### Section: The Simulation (Event Logistics)
* **Schedule:**
    * *Friday, Jan 30:* Opening Ceremony & Open Forum Speech Practice.
    * *Saturday, Jan 31:* Scenario Sessions (AM/PM), Negotiations, Deliverable Drafting.
    * *Sunday, Feb 1:* Final Voting, Closing Ceremony, Awards.
* **Locations:** WCPH Rooms 190, 192, 360, 409, 460, 560.
* **Tech Stack:** EventMobi (app required for real-time updates).

### Section: The Scenarios (Policy Verticals)
*Use the following briefs to populate the "Topics" pages:*

* **Scenario A: Healthy & Sustainable Dietary Guidelines**
    * *Conflict:* Should environmental sustainability and Ultra-Processed Foods (UPFs) be factors in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs)?
    * *Context:* Changes here impact school meals and military rations.
* **Scenario B: Nutrition Education in Schools**
    * *Conflict:* Implementing new grant funding for hands-on food programs. Balancing interests of dairy, beef, produce, and organic sectors.
* **Scenario C: Urban Agriculture**
    * *Conflict:* Developing a strategy for urban farming.
    * *Tension:* "Traditional" farming vs. urban needs (housing, zoning, new farmers).
* **Scenario D: Investing in Rural America**
    * *Conflict:* Allocating \$1 billion in Commodity Credit Corporation funds.
    * *Data Context:* U.S. corn yields are hitting 170+ bushels/acre, yet farm income volatility remains a challenge. AI/Tech investment is a potential avenue for this funding (e.g., bridging the digital divide).
* **Scenario E: FSIS Food Label Guidance**
    * *Conflict:* Substantiating "animal-raising" and environmental claims on meat/poultry labels.
    * *Context:* 16,617 public comments received on recent guidance.
* **Scenario F: Prescribed Burning (Forest Service)**
    * *Conflict:* "Save Our Friends" animal welfare protests vs. Forest Service fire management strategies.

### Section: Research Center (Contextual Data)
*Populate a "Briefing Room" or "Data Bank" with these stats to help students cite evidence in their speeches:*

* **Labor Efficiency:** Farm output per worker grew 16-fold between 1948–2017.
* **Tech Adoption:** 70% of large farms now use GPS guidance.
* **AI Impact:**
    * AI pest management detects infestations with 95% accuracy.
    * Autonomous tractors operating 20% faster than manual ones.
    * AI irrigation reduces water consumption by up to 40%.
* **Sustainability:**
    * Corn yield is up (170+ bushels/acre).
    * Water withdrawals are down despite higher output.

## 5. Design & User Experience (UX) Recommendations
* **Visual Identity:** Professional, federal, yet modern. Use imagery of *high-tech* agriculture (drones, tablets in fields) alongside traditional policy settings (gavels, podiums) to bridge the "Field to Policy" gap.
* **Navigation Structure:**
    * *Home:* Mission & Welcome (Kathleen Merrigan quote).
    * *Agenda:* Interactive timeline.
    * *Briefing Room:* PDF downloads and "Fast Facts" (from Research Section above).
    * *Resources:* Maps, WiFi info, EventMobi link.
* **Accessibility:** Ensure all maps (Hotels-to-WCPH) are mobile-friendly, as participants will be moving between the Hyatt/Omni and WCPH.
